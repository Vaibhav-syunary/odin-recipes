    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        French fries (American English), chips (British English), finger chips (Indian English), french-fried potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut deep fried potatoes. Their origin is disputed. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them. They are usually   fried in a deep fryer. During the process of making, they are pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet 
        potatoes are usually used to make them. French fries can also be baked in a oven.

        French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten for lunch, dinner, or as a snack. They commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, bars, and other places which sells food.
        
        People often put salt on them, and sometimes dip them in ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other condiments. French fries are sometimes topped with poutine and/or chilli con carne. French fries are sometimes made from sweet potatoes, instead of potatoes. When baked in a oven, little oil or no oil, is being used.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

            To prepare this easy recipe, you need to make sure that they are cut in the right shape and size. They should neither be too thick, nor too thin and should be cut clean and sharp. The trick is to first slice the potatoes and then cut them lengthwise. You can also use a fries cutter for that long, even shape.

        <li>Soak cut potatoes in ice-cold water for 10-15 minutes
            Now, wash the potatoes under running water till they are squeaky clean. Place them in a bowl of iced water for 10 to 15 minutes. Keep them submerged in water or they will turn black.
        </li>
        <li>Deep fry the potato fries
            Now, heat the oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the smoke starts appearing, reduce the flame and allow it to acquire a lower temperature. Now, deep fry the potatoes in batches. Keep the flame low. This will make them crunchy and also help retain their colour.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper and serve hot
            Drain excess oil and place them on an absorbent paper. Allow them to cool. Now sprinkle salt and pepper and toss well. Serve immediately with ketchup. They can also be served with burgers and cutlets.
