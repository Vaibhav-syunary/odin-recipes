        Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.

        One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin making pizza, start by preparing the dough. In a bowl, combine all-purpose flour, activated yeast in warm water, olive oil, and salt. Knead the mixture until the dough is smooth and allow it to rise until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Next, create a flavorful pizza sauce. Sauté minced garlic in olive oil, then add crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce until it thickens to your liking.</li>
        <li>Once your dough has risen, preheat the oven and roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface. The thickness of the dough is up to your preference.</li>
        <li>With the rolled-out dough as your canvas, it's time to add the toppings. Spread the prepared pizza sauce over the dough, sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese, and top it off with slices of pepperoni and onions.</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to a high temperature. Bake the pizza until the crust turns golden, and the cheese becomes gooey and irresistible. Remove it from the oven, slice it into pieces, and savor the delightful flavors of your homemade pizza. Adjust the toppings and quantities based on your taste preferences for a truly personalized culinary experience. Enjoy your delicious creation!</li>
